WELCOME TO PIZZA HANGMAN!

This game is a project I made for my first finals at Smith College. Pizza Hangman is basically the traditional Hangman game, but with some 
extra basic graphics (with tkinter) to make it new and hopefully more fun.

FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW TO RUN THE GAME:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed in your environment.
(You can download it from here https://www.python.org/downloads/. Choose the right version for your computer.)

2. Download the game package.

3. Launch a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

4. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the game files. For example, if you downloaded the game to the 
/Users/dothuyduong/Downloads/pizza-hangman/ directory, you can use the following command:

`cd /Users/dothuyduong/Downloads/pizza-hangman/`

5. Execute the following command to start the game:

`python3 main.py`

The game will then start and graphic window should open. 
You can use the graphic window to interact with the game and put your answers down in the console window.
